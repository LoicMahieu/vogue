# Vogue

Vogue creates a real-time link between your web browser and your file system. When you save 
a CSS file, used by the HTML page in your browser, Vogue will make the browser reload the 
stylesheet. Only the stylesheet is reloaded, not the entire page, making it work
even for very dynamic/ajax pages.

Vogue is all javascript. It runs a server on [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/), 
which will watch the file system. 
The server accepts WebSocket connections from the client code 
(which uses [socket.io](http://socket.io/)).
The client javascript can be loaded into a HTML page using a single script tag.

## Usage
Run the Vogue server using node.

`node vogue.js -dir /path/to/website -port 8001`

`-dir : The directory containing your website's files. Optional, defaults to the current directory.`
  
`-port : The port used for Vogue's HTTP server. Optional, defaults to 8001.`

  Open http://localhost:8001/ to see instructions for loading the Vogue client into your
  web pages.

## Demo
Vogue runs a separate HTTP server to the one running your website.
To run the demo website, for example, do something like this first:
  
``cd demo  
python -m SimpleHTTPServer``

Then, from another terminal session, run Vogue:

`node src/vogue.js -dir demo`

Open http://localhost:8000 (or whatever the port used by your web server is) 
to view the demo index page. The demo page has the Vogue client javascript already included.
So it will connect to the Vogue server and be watching the two CSS files used by the page.

Try editing the CSS files in the `demo/styles` directory. Whenever you save, you will see the 
browser update the reflect the changes made. This is done without reloading the entire page.
