Vogue

Vogue creates a real-time link between your web browser and your file system. When you save 
a CSS file, used by the HTML page in your browser, Vogue will make the browser reload the 
stylesheet. Only the stylesheet is reloaded, not the entire page, making it work even for 
very dynamic/ajax pages.

Vogue is all javascript. It runs a server on Node.js, which will watch the file 
system. The server accepts WebSocket connections from the client code (which uses socket.io).
The client javascript can be loaded into a HTML page using a single <script> tag.

Run the Vogue server using node.
  node vogue.js -dir /path/to/website -port 8001

  -dir is optional, defaults to the current directory.
  -port is optional, defaults to 8001.

  Open http://localhost:8001/ to see instructions for loading the Vogue client into your
  web pages.
